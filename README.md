# Smartibot
* I got a [Smartibot cardboard robot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/460355237/smartibot-the-worlds-first-ai-enabled-cardboard-ro) from [https://ruth.ellis.scot/](https://ruth.ellis.scot/) as a gift. It's super powerful and really cool. There's a [webapp](https://thecraftyrobot.github.io/smartibot_webpad/), an [Android app] and a [Chrome IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo?hl=en) (as well as a bunch of [other ways to control Smartibot](http://www.espruino.com/Quick+Start+BLE#smartibot) as it uses low energy [Bluetooth](https://www.espruino.com/Web%20Bluetooth)). The [demo code](http://www.espruino.com/Smartibot) is decent (but the blocks coding in Chrome IDE doesn't seem to work just yet).

* To update the firmware (it's a total faff to do using the NFR Toolbox instructions - just use the [Chrome IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo?hl=en) and a tool called Flasher in the settings section. 
* I found a few bits of code that worked well - [this one especially](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boutell/smartibot-scripts/master/wake-wander-nap-repeat.js) from Tom Boutell. 
* No idea what's up but [Pong](https://crafty-robot.myshopify.com/blogs/projects/pong-with-the-smartibot-distance-sensors-and-led-matrix) will not work
Next step  - I'd love to get some servos (rc 9g servo) and use the servo contollers to do something like bang a bell/drum. 
  I never actually got the distance snesor thing working
