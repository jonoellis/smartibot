# Smartibot

I got a [Smartibot cardboard robot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/460355237/smartibot-the-worlds-first-ai-enabled-cardboard-ro) from [https://ruth.ellis.scot/](https://ruth.ellis.scot/) as a gift. It's super powerful and really cool. There's a [webapp](https://thecraftyrobot.github.io/smartibot_webpad/), an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raa.smartibot&hl=en_GB) and a [Chrome IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo?hl=en) (as well as a bunch of [other ways to control Smartibot](http://www.espruino.com/Quick+Start+BLE#smartibot) as it uses low energy [Bluetooth](https://www.espruino.com/Web%20Bluetooth)). The [demo code](http://www.espruino.com/Smartibot) is decent and there's a bunch of cool projects out there already (the [pugtargeting automatic waterpistol robot](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/comments/8u8l8c/i_made_a_pugtargeting_automatic_waterpistol_robot/) looks fun). 

Tips:
* To update the firmware is a total faff to do using the NFR Toolbox instructions, I recommend following the alternative steps and just use the [Chrome IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo?hl=en) and it's built-in tool called Flasher from the settings section. 
* Some of the code that's out there is great - [this one especially](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boutell/smartibot-scripts/master/wake-wander-nap-repeat.js) from Tom Boutell worked well, but others not so much - [Pong](https://crafty-robot.myshopify.com/blogs/projects/pong-with-the-smartibot-distance-sensors-and-led-matrix) will not work for me at all so I suspect it's something up with the [distance sensor](https://thecraftyrobot.net/blogs/projects/wall-avoiding-robot-with-distance-sensors-and-l-e-d-matrix). 

Future steps:
* I'd love to get some RC 9G servos and use the servo contollers to set up a little band on top of the teabot's platform, using the servos to bang a tiny drum kit.
